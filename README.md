# SIT107 - Task 3.5HD - Something Awesome


'''
this repo is a work in progress many details will be updated and developed over its life cycle
'''

This is an automated IR remoted program. using the DHT22 Temp and Humidity Sensor, the K845754 IR Receiver and the K851262 IR Transmitter.

The objective of this project to develop a program that will observe Temp and Humidity in the environment and automatically transmit an IR signal to activate and air conditioner when conditions are met


## Instrustions for Use

1. download the repo and add the IRremote.zip to libraries (3 required)
2. connect he IR Rx and record code for your remote (see circuit diagrams)
3. upload IR-RX.ino
4. connect the IT TX and DHT22 (see circuit diagram)
5. upload IR-Tx.ino
4. enjoy this code will only work for a specific aircon code will need to be recorded and implemented with a sendNEC to work correctly, this program currently sends in raw due to unexpected technical dificulties
